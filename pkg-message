SurrealDB adopts an extremely permissive version of the Business Source License (BSL), allowing users broad rights for using and scaling the database. The only restriction is that offering SurrealDB as a commercial service requires a separate license, but internal usage remains unrestricted for employees, contractors, and subsidiaries.

Enable the surrealdb service in your FreeBSD system's rc.conf file. You can do this by adding the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

surrealdb_enable="YES"

Optionally, you can also customize the service configuration in rc.conf by specifying additional parameters like memory, port, directory, user, and password. For example:

# Default values
surrealdb_memory="YES"
surrealdb_ip="0.0.0.0:7435"
surrealdb_dir="/var/db/surrealdb"
surrealdb_user="root"
surrealdb_pass="root"

Make sure to set a username and password before the initial startup when using disk-based storage mode, or else the default (root) will remain, and it won't be removed until the directory where the data is stored is deleted.

You can also use surrealdb without the service, running it as the documentation indicates: https://surrealdb.com/docs/cli/start
