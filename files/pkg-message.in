Enable the %%NAME%% service in your FreeBSD system's rc.conf file. You can do this by adding the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

%%NAME%%_enable="YES"

Optionally, you can also customize the service configuration in rc.conf by specifying additional parameters like memory, port, directory, user, and password. For example:

%%NAME%%_memory="YES"
%%NAME%%_ip="0.0.0.0:7435"
%%NAME%%_dir="/var/db/%%NAME%%"
%%NAME%%_user="root"
%%NAME%%_pass="root"

Make sure to set a username and password before the initial startup when using disk-based storage mode, or else the default (root) will remain, and it won't be removed until the directory where the data is stored is deleted.
